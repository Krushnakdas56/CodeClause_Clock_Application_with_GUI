### Clock Application with GUI

# TKINTER

The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

## Packages Used

# Label 

The tkinter label widgets can be used to show text or an image to the screen. A label can only display text in a single font. The text can span multiple lines.

You can put any text in a label and you can have multiple labels in a window (just like any widget can be placed multiple times in a window).

# Time

The time module in Python provides functions for handling time-related tasks.

The time-related tasks includes,

-> reading the current time

-> formatting time

-> sleeping for a specified number of seconds and so on.
